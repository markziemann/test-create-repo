## Question 2

look at the cars dataset

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
str(cars)
head(cars)
```

Make a plot of speed (x) vs distance (y).

```{r plot}

mylm <- lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)
mylm

plot(cars$speed,cars$dist)
abline(mylm)

```

Now find the Pearson correlation coeficient

```{r correl}

cor(cars$speed,cars$dist)
cor.test(cars$speed,cars$dist)

```

Session information

```{r sessioninfo}
sessionInfo()
```
