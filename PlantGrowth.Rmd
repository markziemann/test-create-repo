## Introduction

In this exercise we are analysing the built-in PlantGrowth dataset.

First we will have a look at the data structure.

```{r plantgrowth1}

head(PlantGrowth)
str(PlantGrowth)

```

Subset ctrl, trt1 and trt2 into separate objects.

```{r }

ctrl <- subset(PlantGrowth,group=="ctrl")
summary(ctrl)
boxplot(ctrl)

```
